### Homework
- Wikipedia Layout 2 – Use the same HTML from your in-class typography exercise, but create a completely new layout for it using CSS. You should use different fonts, different type styles, etc.
  Try to make this second version as different as possible from your first layout. Remember – your HTML (the structure) doesn't change, but your CSS (the style, how it looks)
  does change. Think about how much of a difference your styles can make to the same content.
- Upload your second layout to your GitHub repo and link to it from your home page.
