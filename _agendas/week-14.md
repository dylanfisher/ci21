- Announcements and group meetings

### Homework
- For homework, aim to have a very basic version of your project online. The site should be a prototype of how you imagine it to work and function, but can omit visual design and total functionality. We will test the prototypes in class, so make sure to have something to share (can be rough and gestural, but should go through the motions of what you&rsquo;d like to communicate)
