- [Input/Output, Part 2](https://vimeo.com/537297571)

### Homework
- Continue to refine your Input/Output projects. Think about what technical components your project involves and come to class next week with a proof-of-concept prototype of this interaction.
  This could be the start of your design, or just a rough sketch showing what the basis of your input/output is. Let's try to identify tricky areas of your project so that we can work together
  to come up with a solution in code.
