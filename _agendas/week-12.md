### Friday, Lab
- [Zoom room](https://newschool.zoom.us/j/3928062190)
- [CI Lab, Week 12 – Data Storage and Real Time Interactions](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Data-Storage-and-Real-Time-Interactions--BI6u5JK6MapDmQaW4QcKlX_IAg-95nYfE5Li8FlY5jSZtXsd)
- [CI21 Glitch Collection](https://glitch.com/@dylanfisher/ci-21)

  - [Real-Time Paintbrush](https://glitch.com/~ci21-real-time-paintbrush)
  - [Real-Time Chat](https://glitch.com/~ci21-real-time-chat)

### This week's lab demo videos
- [Input/Output, Part 1](https://vimeo.com/537294028)
- [Input/Output, Part 2](https://vimeo.com/537297571)

### Homework
- Choose one of the Glitch demos to remix. Use the demo as a starting point to reinterpret the demo and experiment
  with the possibilities of that technology (either persistent storage or websockets). You'll need to make changes
  to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to make the demo your own.
- Next week you'll present your demo to the class and explain how you changed the code. You should also begin
  thinking about how this technology relates to your final project [Input/Output](/projects/4-input-output).
- Your final Input/Output project doesn't need to use Glitch (or these demos), but these could be inspiration
  for potential directions to take your project in, and this technology allows you to create interactions that
  aren't otherwise possible in a purely static site (like what you have hosted on GitHub).
