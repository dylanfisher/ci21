### Homework
- Finish the questionnaire.
- Set up your GitHub account and GitHub desktop app by following the lab demo video.
- Create a basic home page for your GitHub account, making sure that your GitHub Pages site is set up properly. If I visit
  your site, I should be able to see it at a domain that looks similar to this: [http://fisherdm.github.io](http://fisherdm.github.io).
- Before our next class, double-check that your username is properly linked to your GitHub page on our class site's [student list](https://ci.labud.nyc/students/).
  If this link isn't automatically working after you've set up GitHub, post the URL of your GitHub profile in our class Slack channel `#a-simovich-fisher` and ping
  me saying that it is not linked.
