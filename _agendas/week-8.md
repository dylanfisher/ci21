### Homework
- Complete the JavaScript DOM Manipulation exercise and link to it from your GitHub page. Each member of each group needs to upload their own version of the code.
- Add an additional 10 books to your [Airtable bookshelves](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Airtable-Setup--BGQfI7uEy1wIbhdeYXj6XjjjAg-Rm1DcYZjqWxPfRoyBt9tx). When we regroup after spring break we'll be pulling these books in via Airtable's API and doing some DOM manipulation. Make sure you watch the two upcoming Airtable videos so that you know what to expect.
- Over spring break you'll be writing some JavaScript! Sign up for a free [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account and complete the following lessons in the [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) courses below. Take a screenshot of your entire browser window to show that you completed each lesson.

### Thursday, Studio
- [Zoom room](https://newschool.zoom.us/my/nikafisher)
- [Today&rsquo;s Notes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Parsons-Week-8b-Elastic-Collections-and-Midterm-Meetings--BGpoSF99YXg7Ldrofb_29nm9AQ-383VaRuffJL7ENPf7egri)
- Hear from Gia and discuss The Hidden Life of an Amazon User – Joana Moll
- Discuss project ideas in small groups
- Midterm evaluation meetings with half the class

### Homework
- Refine the collection concept and create/gather new, stronger images until you have at least 100.
- Organize these 100 items into 3 sub-categories. These might be filters or sorting - mechanisms. (Sorted by age, for example; Filtered by size). At this point you - should be finding similarities, drawing connections, and developing a concept or - narrative for your collection.
- In writing, prepare a summary of what you’d like to investigate with your collection.
- Present sketches of 3 vastly different ways of viewing your collection using Figma
