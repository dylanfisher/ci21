  - [Glitch demo showing off the Airtable API + bookshelf demo](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/interaction-lab-bookshelf)

### Homework
- Continue working on the [Airtable API](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/CI-Lab-Week-9-Airtable-API--BHmdterYjCHBpEGofsMJLnGxAg-is9ilnbYOjn3LaXgbUZfC)
  integration. By next week you should have a page that pulls data from one of your Airtable bases and inserts content into the page. You must do
  more than just insert a row of books with a background image using the cover and the title of the book, like from my example. If you want to
  receive credit for the assignment you must make the code your own and do something new and interesting with the data.
